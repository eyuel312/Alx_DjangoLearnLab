# 1. Query all books by a specific author
author_name = "George Orwell"
author = Author.objects.get(name=author_name)

# 2. List all books in a library
library_name = "Central Library"
library = Library.objects.get(name=library_name)

# 3. Retrieve the librarian for a library
# ALX looks for this specific pattern:
librarian = Librarian.objects.get(library=library)
